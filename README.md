The above work represents in class work for course CS 6301 R for Data Scientists. The aim of this task is to perform exploratory data analysis by performing PCA of high dimentional datasets. Thus reperforming the unsupervised learning exploiting PCA to improve model accuracy.

R Script for the project can be found in the "script.R" file.
